# Brochure Project Using LLMs

This project is part of the "Become an LLM Engineer in 8 Weeks" course on Udemy, which covers building and deploying 8 LLM-based applications while mastering Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LoRA, and AI agents.

The goal of this project is to build an AI agent that automatically generates a brochure for a company by extracting and summarizing content from its website. The agent performs web scraping across multiple pages and uses OpenAI's API to generate brochure-ready content.

## How It Works
The solution uses two key API calls to OpenAI:

1. Extract Links
Scrapes the website and returns relevant URLs in JSON format.

2. Generate Brochure
Gathers content from those URLs and uses it to create a structured brochure.

## Exercise Objective
The exercise encourages building something personally useful. I created a Quickstart Generator to help users learn new tools more efficiently â€” especially when faced with overwhelming documentation and unclear starting points.

### Output Includes
1. A concise Quick Start Guide
2. A Learning Roadmap for the tool
3. A Reference Table of essential commands and scripts

This tool is especially useful for quickly onboarding yourself or others to unfamiliar technologies.
